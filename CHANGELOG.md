# Changelog

All notable changes to Ludwig are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Core loop**: prompt → Claude writes Blender Python → headless render →
  Claude vision-critiques the render → iterate.
- **Judge panel**: N diverse candidates per round, scored on a 5-axis rubric
  (framing, lighting, materials, brief-coverage, believability), score-gated
  across rounds.
- **Realism toolkit** (`ludwig_blender_lib.py`): procedural PBR materials,
  balanced lighting presets, a studio set (seamless sweep backdrop + 3-point
  rig), and bounding-box auto-framing.
- **`--edit`**: surgically re-prompt an existing scene ("same, but taller / in
  brass") — the design-as-code editability moat.
- **`--quick`**: fast single-shot mode (1 candidate, 1 round) for iterating.
- Cycles "hero shot" re-render of the winning scene.
- Inference via the local `claude` CLI (no API key); cross-platform Blender
  detection; retrying inference with backoff; preflight checks.
- Smoke tests and CI.

### Added (post-v0)
- **`L_seat(*objs)`** toolkit helper — drops a mesh, or a whole assembly while
  preserving relative positions, onto the floor (z=0). Directly attacks the
  critic's most frequent complaint after bad crops: subjects that float or sink.
  Wired into the codegen + edit briefs so the model uses it.
- **`--selftest`** — one command that verifies the whole stack (pure-Python unit
  suite + a real Blender render through the toolkit, asserting L_seat grounds the
  subject and the frame isn't void) in ~2s, spending zero claude tokens. Exits
  non-zero on failure, so it doubles as a CI gate.

### Fixed
- **Render timeouts no longer crash the run.** A slow Cycles hero render that
  exceeded the subprocess budget raised an uncaught `TimeoutExpired`, killing the
  whole pipeline *after* all the codegen/critique work. `render()` now catches it
  and reports a normal render failure (hero renders also get a 600s budget).
- **Stale renders can no longer mask a failed render.** Because Blender exits 0
  even when a script raises, file-existence is the success signal — but a leftover
  PNG from a previous run reusing the same slug could falsely pass. `render()` now
  removes any existing output first, so the file reflects the current run.
- `--edit` now reports honestly when the hero re-render fails instead of always
  printing success.
- Preflight prints a non-fatal note when Pillow is missing (void-frame detection
  is disabled, so empty renders would otherwise silently cost a critique call).

### Known limitations
- Geometry is primitive-assembled — strongest on hero objects / product renders;
  complex multi-object interiors are still crude. Richer geometry helpers are on
  the roadmap.
- The critic is a tough grader; scores are a relative signal, not an absolute one.
