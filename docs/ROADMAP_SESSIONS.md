# Ludwig — Session Roadmap

One PR per session. Every session leaves `python3 cli.py --selftest` green and the repo shippable.
This sequences [BRIEF.md](../BRIEF.md) §7 into concrete sessions. P2–P4 are deliberately held at lower
resolution — per first principle #7, grow from real use, don't pre-plan the far future.

Legend: **Gate** = the demonstrable thing that proves the session is done.

---

## S1 — Re-foundation reset  ✅ (this session)
Tag `mesh-era-m4`; branch `refoundation`. Finalize the founding doc (BRIEF.md) with the 7 hardening
edits. Rewrite CLAUDE.md / README. Build the `ir/ geometry/ backends/ critic/ agent/ toolkit/ prompts/
store/` skeleton as importable stubs. Salvage the provider-blind inference (`agent/inference.py`) and the
`L_*` render toolkit (`backends/render_toolkit.py`). Delete all mesh-substrate / wrong-shell scaffolding.
**Gate:** clean tree on the new structure; skeleton imports clean; `cli.py --selftest` + CI green; BRIEF.md canonical.

## P0 — The spine

### S2 — IR core + geometry service + the pass-rate instrument  ✅
`Element/Part`, `Param` (unit-carrying), `Relation`, `NamedDim`, `ProgramNode`. `BRepHandle` + the
CadQuery/OCCT service (lazy). The thin `toolkit/` element-API seed (box, hole, register-dim).
**[H6]** Stand up the frozen held-out brief set + the `first-pass geometric pass-rate` harness in `eval/`.
**Gate:** build the bracket IR in code; bbox 80×40×6 ±1e-3, two ⌀ correct holes; pass-rate harness runs and reports a number.
**Done:** real OCCT geometry via CadQuery; `cli.py --selftest` runs the bracket gate (kernel-guarded),
`cli.py --eval` reports the pass-rate (100% on the reference oracle over a 5-brief frozen set), standards.yaml
resolves clearance holes (M8→⌀9.0). The LLM codegen builder replaces the oracle in **S3** — then the number gets real.

### S3 — The loop  ✅
Port the provider-blind inference into a real `agent/loop.py`: codegen → execute → (provisional verify) → repair,
pointed at the IR. `prompts/codegen.md` + `prompts/repair.md`. Cheap-model codegen, seam unchanged.
**Gate:** prompt → generated CadQuery program → executed IR for the bracket, end to end, headless.
**Done:** `cli.py "<prompt>"` compiles live via `claude` (bracket → exact 80×40×6 B-rep, 0 repair rounds).
`cli.py --eval --live` swaps the oracle for real codegen → **first real first-pass geometric pass-rate: 60% (3/5)**
([H1] confirmed; see `docs/FINDINGS.md`). Loop tests run token-free via mocked inference. Verify is provisional —
the real critic panel is S4.

### S4 — Deterministic critic v0
The verifier panel: `geometric` (manifold/watertight/self-intersection), `dimensional` (named-dim exact, 1e-6),
`semantic` (holes through material, units present, no orphans). Critic JSON feeds repair. `prompts/critic.md`.
**Gate:** a dimensionally-wrong bracket fails the right check; repair fixes it; re-verify passes. Loop closes on the critic.

### S5 — STEP backend + rebuilt `--selftest`
`backends/step.py` (OCCT STEP write, gated as a fabrication export per permissions). Rebuild `cli.py --selftest`
around the bracket spine (no LLM tokens). FreeCAD-open verification.
**Gate:** `cli.py "steel bracket 80×40×6, two M8 holes"` → STEP that opens in FreeCAD with correct geometry.

### S6 — `--edit` minimal-diff + lineage/provenance
`--edit` re-prompts the program and emits a *minimal* diff. `provenance` resolves a selection to a program node
(**[H2]** never a kernel handle). Lineage stable across regeneration.
**Gate:** "make the holes M10" changes only the relevant lines; the rest of the diff is empty.

### S7 — Drawing backend (P0.5, outside the spine gate)
`backends/drawing.py`: OCCT HLR → SVG + ezdxf DXF, dims queried from the manifest. Exact↔polygonal HLR toggle.
**Gate:** the bracket yields a readable dimensioned elevation. (Fragile-by-nature; intentionally not gating the spine.)

**→ P0 complete:** prompt → exact B-rep → critic all-pass → STEP (FreeCAD-valid) → minimal-diff edit → derived drawing.

## P1 — Components & domain (fabrication shop tool) — ~4–6 sessions
`Assembly`, `Panel`/`Profile`. `backends/ifc.py` (IfcOpenShell, IFC4precast). `backends/render.py` wiring the
salvaged `render_toolkit.py`. Pairwise judge panel. Real min-wall. Clearances/cover from `standards.yaml`.
**[H7] decision point:** confirm the one IR serves fab + first BIM type without contortion (or fork deliberately).
**Gate (BRIEF §7):** precast panel → IFC4precast + STEP + shop drawing + render, all critic-verified.

## P2 — Buildings (architect tool) — multi-session, drawing engine alone is several
`SpatialElement`, relationship graph, `Space`/`Storey`/`Project`, hierarchical program, IDS+geometry compliance
critic, rich crystallization behavior **[H3]**, and the **conventioned drawing engine** (the real moat / hardest part).

## P3 — The application (Tauri shell, the Stage & Director UI — see docs/UX_BRIEF.md)
Desktop shell, representation switcher, point-to-navigate, ambient correctness, plan-mode/permissions/hooks,
parameter sliders, exploration contact-sheet, presentation auto-assembly backend.

## P4 — Scale
Hierarchical agentic loop over a deep IR (massing → plates → cores → units → details), cascade repair, branching.
